### My name is Preston Evers. I am a Data Engineer based out of Omaha, NE. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working improving ETL and reporting processes at Lincoln Premium Poultry in Omaha, NE.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Powershell scripting to help reduce Azure expenditure by pushing resource intensive API calls down from Azure Data Factory to LPP's on-prem environment. I plan to use powershell scripts to reduce the costs of pipeline orchestration in Azure Data Factory by triggering ETLs with powershell scripts that run on our on-prem task manager.
